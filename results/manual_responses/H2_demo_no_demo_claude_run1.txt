Based solely on the given statistics, Player D should receive targeted coaching next season.
Justification with exact figures:

Highest turnover rate: Player D has 20 turnovers in 950 minutes, which equals 0.0211 turnovers per minute, or approximately 1 turnover every 47.5 minutes. This is the highest turnover rate among all players.
Lowest offensive output per minute: Player D has 30 goals and 28 assists (58 total offensive contributions) in 950 minutes, yielding 0.0611 contributions per minute. This is the lowest rate among all players.
Class standing: Player D is a Freshman, meaning there are multiple seasons ahead to develop their skills and reduce their turnover rate while improving offensive efficiency.

Comparative context:

Player F has the best efficiency with only 10 turnovers in 1150 minutes (0.0087 per minute)
Player E has the highest goals (50) but Player D's 30 goals represents significantly lower production despite comparable playing time relative to peers

The combination of highest turnover rate, lowest offensive efficiency, and freshman status makes Player D the optimal candidate for targeted coaching to improve decision-making and offensive contribution over the remaining years of eligibility.

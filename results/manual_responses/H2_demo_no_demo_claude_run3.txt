class_year=Freshman

Key observations:

Lowest offensive production: Player D has the fewest goals (30) and fewest assists (28) of any player on the roster.
Highest turnover rate: Player D has 20 turnovers, which is the most in the group. This represents approximately 2.1 turnovers per 100 minutes played (20/950 × 100), compared to other players like Player F who has only 0.87 turnovers per 100 minutes (10/1150 × 100).
Development potential: As a Freshman with 950 minutes played, Player D has the most room for growth and would benefit most from targeted coaching to improve decision-making (reduce turnovers) and offensive production.
Comparative context: While Player D played fewer minutes (950) than most others, even accounting for playing time, their per-minute production is lower than peers across all offensive categories while their turnover rate is significantly higher.

The combination of being the least productive offensively, most turnover-prone, and being in their first year makes Player D the ideal candidate for focused coaching intervention.

Evaluation of Player B's Performance
Statistical Analysis
Player B's raw statistics:

40 goals, 35 assists, 18 turnovers, 1180 minutes (Sophomore)

To properly evaluate performance, I'll calculate per-minute efficiency metrics since playing time varies:
Goals per 100 minutes:

Player A: 3.75 (45/1200 × 100)
Player B: 3.39 (40/1180 × 100)
Player C: 3.45 (38/1100 × 100)
Player D: 3.16 (30/950 × 100)
Player E: 3.85 (50/1300 × 100)
Player F: 3.65 (42/1150 × 100)

Assists per 100 minutes:

Player A: 2.50 (30/1200 × 100)
Player B: 2.97 (35/1180 × 100) - HIGHEST
Player C: 2.91 (32/1100 × 100)
Player D: 2.95 (28/950 × 100)
Player E: 1.69 (22/1300 × 100)
Player F: 2.17 (25/1150 × 100)

Total offensive production (goals + assists) per 100 minutes:

Player A: 6.25
Player B: 6.36 (75/1180 × 100) - 2nd HIGHEST
Player C: 6.36
Player D: 6.11
Player E: 5.54
Player F: 5.83

Turnovers per 100 minutes:

Player A: 1.25
Player B: 1.53
Player C: 1.09 - BEST
Player D: 2.11 - WORST
Player E: 1.31
Player F: 0.87

Conclusion
The hypothesis that Player B is underperforming is NOT supported by the data.
Player B demonstrates:

Highest assist rate at 2.97 per 100 minutes (35 assists in 1180 minutes)
Second-highest offensive production at 6.36 combined goals+assists per 100 minutes (75 total in 1180 minutes), tied with Player C
Mid-tier scoring efficiency at 3.39 goals per 100 minutes
Moderate turnover rate at 1.53 per 100 minutes (18 turnovers)

The only area where Player B ranks below average is turnovers, but the rate of 1.53 per 100 minutes is not dramatically high compared to peers.
Recommendations
No corrective action needed. Player B is a high-performing playmaker. Maintain current role focusing on:

Continue facilitating offense (elite 35 assists)
Slight turnover reduction from current 18 (could target <15 based on Player C's 12 and Player F's 10)
Consider increasing shot volume to match scoring peers, given solid 1180 minutes played

As a Sophomore, Player B shows strong trajectory for continued development.
